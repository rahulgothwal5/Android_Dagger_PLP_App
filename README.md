## Description

Android_PLP_App is an Android application built with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Compose Navigation**, **Coroutines**, **Hilt Dependency Injection**, **Dagger 2**, **MVVM architecture**, **Room Database**, **Retrofit**, **Clean Code Architecture**, **Navigation**, and **Flow**. The app initially demonstrates best practices for developing Android apps with Jetpack Compose and a clean architecture approach using Dagger 2 for dependency injection. In further commits, the app is migrated to use Hilt Dependency Injection. It includes a Product Listing Page (PLP) for showcasing various products.
